 ## Summary
 This was my first project using React. There was a lot of time spent understanding core concepts such as state, props, 
 and JSON stringify for local data storage. 
 Overall it was a big adventure and undertaking, but it was a great learning experience!
 
   #### ToDo: Move input forms to a Modal & debug local storage useEffect
